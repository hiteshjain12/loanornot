# Financial Calculators üí∞

A smart suite of financial decision tools to help you make better money choices. Includes:
- **LoanOrNot**: Decide whether to take a loan and invest your cash, or pay upfront for a purchase.
- **Goal Calculator**: Find out how much you need to save each month to reach a future financial goal, accounting for inflation and your existing investments.

## üéØ Purpose

- Should you take a loan and invest your cash, or pay upfront?
- How much should you save each month to reach a goal in X years, given inflation and your current savings?

- **Visual recommendations** with color-coded results
- **Detailed breakdown** of all scenarios
- **Net benefit analysis** showing the financial difference

- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Financial calculations and interactivity
- **No dependencies** - Runs entirely in the browser

## üìä How It Works

### LoanOrNot Calculator

**Option 1: Pay Cash**
- Remaining cash after purchase gets invested
- Returns calculated using compound interest formula
- Net position = remaining cash + investment returns

**Option 2: Take Loan**
- All available cash gets invested
- Loan interest calculated using standard loan payment formula
- Net position = total investment returns - total loan interest

**Recommendation**
- Compares net positions of both options
- Shows which option provides better financial outcome
- Displays the monetary difference over the specified time period

### Goal Calculator

**Purpose:**
- Find out how much you need to save each month to reach a future goal, given the cost today, years to achieve, expected investment return, inflation, and your existing investment for the goal.

**Inputs:**
- Goal name (optional)
- Cost today (‚Çπ)
- Existing investment for this goal (‚Çπ)
- Years to achieve
- Expected investment return (% annually)
- Inflation rate (% annually, default 6%)

**Outputs:**
- Future cost of your goal (adjusted for inflation)
- Future value of your existing investment
- Required monthly investment (if needed)
- If your existing investment is already enough, you'll be congratulated!

**Key Formulas:**
- **Future Cost:** `Future Cost = Cost Today √ó (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years`
- **Future Value of Existing Investment:** `FV = Existing Investment √ó (1 + Investment Return)^Years`
- **Monthly Investment Needed:**
  - If more is needed: `PMT = (Future Cost - FV) √ó r / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`
    - where r = monthly investment return, n = total months

## üí° Example Scenarios

### LoanOrNot: Conservative Investment
- Purchase: ‚Çπ50,000
- Available Cash: ‚Çπ60,000
- Loan Rate: 6.5%
- Investment Return: 7.0%
- Period: 5 years
- **Result**: Small benefit to taking loan due to higher investment returns

### LoanOrNot: Aggressive Investment
- Purchase: ‚Çπ100,000
- Available Cash: ‚Çπ120,000
- Loan Rate: 4.5%
- Investment Return: 10.0%
- Period: 10 years
- **Result**: Significant benefit to taking loan due to much higher investment returns

### Goal Calculator: Dream Vacation
- Goal: Dream Vacation
- Cost Today: ‚Çπ2,00,000
- Existing Investment: ‚Çπ50,000
- Years to Achieve: 5
- Expected Investment Return: 8%
- Inflation Rate: 6%
- **Result**: Future cost is ‚Çπ2,67,646. You need to invest ‚Çπ2,500/month (example) to reach your goal.
