# Financial Calculators 💰

A comprehensive suite of financial decision tools to help you make smarter money choices. This interactive web application provides three powerful calculators:

- **🏦 LoanOrNot Calculator**: Decide whether to take a loan and invest your cash, or pay upfront for a purchase
- **🎯 Goal Calculator**: Plan and track your savings to achieve future financial goals with inflation adjustment
- **🚗 EV vs ICE Calculator**: Compare Total Cost of Ownership between Electric and Internal Combustion Engine vehicles

## 🎯 Purpose

This application helps you make informed financial decisions by answering three critical questions:

1. **💰 Loan vs Cash Decision**: Should you take a loan and invest your available cash, or pay upfront for a purchase?
2. **📈 Goal Planning**: How much should you save monthly to reach a financial goal, considering inflation and existing investments?
3. **🚙 Vehicle Choice**: Should you buy an Electric Vehicle or Internal Combustion Engine vehicle based on your specific usage patterns and costs?

## 📊 How It Works

### LoanOrNot Calculator

**Option 1: Pay Cash**

- Remaining cash after purchase gets invested
- Returns calculated using compound interest formula
- Net position = remaining cash + investment returns

**Option 2: Take Loan**

- All available cash gets invested
- Loan interest calculated using standard loan payment formula
- Net position = total investment returns - total loan interest

**Recommendation**

- Compares net positions of both options
- Shows which option provides better financial outcome
- Displays the monetary difference over the specified time period

### Goal Calculator

**Purpose:**
Plan your savings strategy to achieve future financial goals while accounting for inflation and existing investments. The calculator provides month-by-month guidance and visual progress tracking.

**Inputs:**

- **Goal Name**: Descriptive name for your financial objective (e.g., "Dream House", "Child's Education")
- **Existing Investment**: Amount already invested towards this specific goal (₹)
- **Cost Today**: Current cost of your goal in today's money (₹)
- **Years to Achieve**: Time horizon for reaching your goal (1-50 years)
- **Expected Investment Return**: Annual return rate you expect from investments (%)
- **Inflation Rate**: Expected annual inflation rate (%, default: 6%)

**Comprehensive Outputs:**

1. **📊 Future Cost Analysis**
   - Inflation-adjusted future cost of your goal
   - Breakdown showing today's cost vs inflation impact

2. **💰 Investment Strategy**
   - Required monthly investment amount
   - Future value of existing investments
   - Congratulatory message if existing investment is sufficient

3. **📈 Year-by-Year Progress Table**
   - Annual invested amounts
   - Investment returns earned each year
   - Total investment value progression
   - Goal achievement percentage with progress indicators

4. **📊 Interactive Progress Chart**
   - Visual representation of investment growth
   - Goal target line for easy comparison
   - Color-coded progress indicators

**Mathematical Formulas:**

- **Future Cost with Inflation:** `FV = PV × (1 + i)^n`
- **Future Value of Existing Investment:** `FV = PV × (1 + r)^n`
- **Monthly Investment (PMT):** `PMT = FV × r / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`
  - Where: r = monthly rate, n = total months
- **Compound Growth:** Accounts for reinvestment of returns annually

### EV vs ICE Calculator

**Purpose:**

- Compare the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) between Electric Vehicles and Internal Combustion Engine vehicles
- Calculate breakeven point when EV becomes cost-effective
- Provide year-by-year cost analysis with visual chart

**Inputs:**

_EV Details:_

- Purchase Price (₹)
- Expected Resale Value (% of purchase price)
- Efficiency (km/kWh, default: 5)
- Electricity Cost (₹/kWh, default: 8)
- Annual Maintenance (₹)
- Insurance per Year (₹)
- Government Incentives (₹)

_ICE Details:_

- Purchase Price (₹)
- Expected Resale Value (% of purchase price)
- Fuel Efficiency (km/l, default: 15)
- Fuel Cost (₹/l, default: 100)
- Annual Maintenance (₹)
- Insurance per Year (₹)

_Usage:_

- Average Distance per Year (km)
- Ownership Period (years)

**Outputs:**

- **Smart Recommendation** with color-coded results
- **Breakeven Analysis** - When EV becomes cost-effective
- **EV and ICE Breakdowns** - Complete cost analysis for both
- **Year-by-Year Comparison Table** - Shows break-even status each year
- **Interactive Visual Chart** - Cost progression with breakeven point marked
- **Total Savings** calculation and explanation

**Key Formula:**

- **TCO = Upfront Cost + Recurring Cost (years 2 to N) + End-of-life Adjustment (resale value)**
- **Breakeven Year:** Calculated when cumulative EV costs equal cumulative ICE costs
- **Operating Costs:** Fuel/Energy + Maintenance + Insurance per year
