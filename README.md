# Financial Calculators üí∞

A smart suite of financial decision tools to help you make better money choices. Includes:
- **LoanOrNot**: Decide whether to take a loan and invest your cash, or pay upfront for a purchase.
- **Goal Calculator**: Find out how much you need to save each month to reach a future financial goal, accounting for inflation and your existing investments.
- **EV vs ICE Calculator**: Compare the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) between Electric Vehicles and Internal Combustion Engine vehicles with breakeven analysis.

## üéØ Purpose

This app helps you answer three key questions:
- Should you take a loan and invest your cash, or pay upfront?
- How much should you save each month to reach a goal in X years, given inflation and your current savings?
- Should you buy an Electric Vehicle or stick with an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle based on your usage and costs?

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-tab UI**: Switch between different calculators (LoanOrNot, Goal Calculator, EV vs ICE Calculator)
- **Real-time calculations** as you type
- **Remembers your data**: All form values and last visited tab are saved and restored on page refresh
- **Visual recommendations** with color-coded results
- **Detailed breakdown** of all scenarios
- **Net benefit analysis** showing the financial difference
- **Responsive design** works on desktop and mobile
- **Input validation** with helpful error messages

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **HTML5** - Structure and semantics
- **Tailwind CSS** - Modern styling and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Financial calculations and interactivity
- **No dependencies** - Runs entirely in the browser

## üìä How It Works

### LoanOrNot Calculator

**Option 1: Pay Cash**
- Remaining cash after purchase gets invested
- Returns calculated using compound interest formula
- Net position = remaining cash + investment returns

**Option 2: Take Loan**
- All available cash gets invested
- Loan interest calculated using standard loan payment formula
- Net position = total investment returns - total loan interest

**Recommendation**
- Compares net positions of both options
- Shows which option provides better financial outcome
- Displays the monetary difference over the specified time period

### Goal Calculator

**Purpose:**
- Find out how much you need to save each month to reach a future goal, given the cost today, years to achieve, expected investment return, inflation, and your existing investment for the goal.

**Inputs:**
- Goal name (optional)
- Cost today (‚Çπ)
- Existing investment for this goal (‚Çπ)
- Years to achieve
- Expected investment return (% annually)
- Inflation rate (% annually, default 6%)

**Outputs:**
- Future cost of your goal (adjusted for inflation)
- Future value of your existing investment
- Required monthly investment (if needed)
- If your existing investment is already enough, you'll be congratulated!

**Key Formulas:**
- **Future Cost:** `Future Cost = Cost Today √ó (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years`
- **Future Value of Existing Investment:** `FV = Existing Investment √ó (1 + Investment Return)^Years`
- **Monthly Investment Needed:**
  - If more is needed: `PMT = (Future Cost - FV) √ó r / ((1 + r)^n - 1)`
    - where r = monthly investment return, n = total months

### EV vs ICE Calculator

**Purpose:**
- Compare the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) between Electric Vehicles and Internal Combustion Engine vehicles
- Calculate breakeven point when EV becomes cost-effective
- Provide year-by-year cost analysis with visual chart

**Inputs:**

*EV Details:*
- Purchase Price (‚Çπ)
- Expected Resale Value (% of purchase price)
- Efficiency (km/kWh, default: 5)
- Electricity Cost (‚Çπ/kWh, default: 8)
- Annual Maintenance (‚Çπ)
- Insurance per Year (‚Çπ)
- Government Incentives (‚Çπ)

*ICE Details:*
- Purchase Price (‚Çπ)
- Expected Resale Value (% of purchase price)
- Fuel Efficiency (km/l, default: 15)
- Fuel Cost (‚Çπ/l, default: 100)
- Annual Maintenance (‚Çπ)
- Insurance per Year (‚Çπ)

*Usage:*
- Average Distance per Year (km)
- Ownership Period (years)

**Outputs:**
- **Smart Recommendation** with color-coded results
- **Breakeven Analysis** - When EV becomes cost-effective
- **EV and ICE Breakdowns** - Complete cost analysis for both
- **Year-by-Year Comparison Table** - Shows break-even status each year
- **Interactive Visual Chart** - Cost progression with breakeven point marked
- **Total Savings** calculation and explanation

**Key Formula:**
- **TCO = Upfront Cost + Recurring Cost (years 2 to N) + End-of-life Adjustment (resale value)**
- **Breakeven Year:** Calculated when cumulative EV costs equal cumulative ICE costs
- **Operating Costs:** Fuel/Energy + Maintenance + Insurance per year

## üí° Example Scenarios

### LoanOrNot: Conservative Investment
- Purchase: ‚Çπ50,000
- Available Cash: ‚Çπ60,000
- Loan Rate: 6.5%
- Investment Return: 7.0%
- Period: 5 years
- **Result**: Small benefit to taking loan due to higher investment returns

### LoanOrNot: Aggressive Investment
- Purchase: ‚Çπ100,000
- Available Cash: ‚Çπ120,000
- Loan Rate: 4.5%
- Investment Return: 10.0%
- Period: 10 years
- **Result**: Significant benefit to taking loan due to much higher investment returns

### Goal Calculator: Dream Vacation
- Goal: Dream Vacation
- Cost Today: ‚Çπ2,00,000
- Existing Investment: ‚Çπ50,000
- Years to Achieve: 5
- Expected Investment Return: 8%
- Inflation Rate: 6%
- **Result**: Future cost is ‚Çπ2,67,646. You need to invest ‚Çπ2,500/month (example) to reach your goal.

### EV vs ICE: Urban Commuter
- EV: ‚Çπ15,00,000 purchase, 5 km/kWh efficiency, ‚Çπ15,000 maintenance
- ICE: ‚Çπ12,00,000 purchase, 15 km/l efficiency, ‚Çπ25,000 maintenance
- Usage: 12,000 km/year for 8 years
- Electricity: ‚Çπ8/kWh, Fuel: ‚Çπ100/l
- **Result**: EV breaks even after 4.2 years, saves ‚Çπ2,50,000 over 8 years

### EV vs ICE: Highway Driver
- EV: ‚Çπ20,00,000 purchase, 4 km/kWh efficiency (highway)
- ICE: ‚Çπ15,00,000 purchase, 18 km/l efficiency (highway)
- Usage: 25,000 km/year for 5 years
- **Result**: ICE remains cost-effective due to high usage and lower highway EV efficiency
